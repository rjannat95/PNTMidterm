Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. Programing language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do. It is used to write all computer
programs and computer software. For example: java is a type of programing language.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
what is class? Ans: A class is a blueprint.

What is object? Ans: Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application? Ans: The entry point of an application is the main method.

Why main is static? Ans: It can invoke it without instantiating the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes? Ans: Object class is the root or superclass of the class hierarchy.

What is difference between path and classpath variables? Ans: Path is set for java tools in java programs like java which
are used to compile the code. Classpath is used by System or application class loader to locate and load compile java bytecodes
stored in the class file.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class? Ans: An abstract class allows you to create functionality
that subclasses can implement or override. But interface only allows you to define functionality, not implement it.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class? if not how do you use it ? Ans: You can not create an object
from an interface or abstract since they are incomplete class. You can implement a subclass of abstract class but it must
not be abstract.

what is Access Specifier? Ans: Access specifier is to set access levels for classes, variables,
methods, and constructors. The four access levels are private, public, protected, and no modifiers/ keywords needed.

What is OOP? Define each feature of java OOP. Ans: OOP stands for Object-Oriented programming. OOP concepts lets us create
working methods and variables, then reuse all or part of them without compromising security. OOP concept include abstraction,
encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another
class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. Polymorphism means many forms and it occurs when
we have many classes that are related to each other by Inheritance. Remember, Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and
methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a
single action in different ways.Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only
functionality to the user. And the only details that the User needs to know are there and everything else is hidden.
Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default? Ans: Java package is used to group related classes. Packages
are used to avoid name conflicts. java.lang package is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far. Ans: Application Programming interface delivers a user response to
a system and sends back systems response back to user.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not? Ans: Java supports multiple inheritance only through interfaces.
Because a class can implement any number of interface but can extend only one class. but multiple inheritance is not supported
because it can cause problems.

What is method overloading and when it happens? Ans: Method overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have
the same method name but different parameters. It occurs when two methods have the same method name and parameters.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it. Ans: Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during
the execution of a program at run time. Try-catch to handle it. Put the code you want to run in the try block, and any Java
exceptions that the code throws are caught by one or more catch blocks.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods? Ans: It is a keyword which is used to share
the same variable or method of a given class. A static method manipulates the static variables in a class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods? Ans: Final is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a
class, variable, and method. If use final keyword to initialize then it can not be modify its values.

What is final, finally and finalize? Ans: Final is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method.
Finally is a block in Java used for Exception Handling. Finalize is a method in Java used for Garbage Collection.

What is a constructor? Ans: A constructors is a special method that is used to initialize objects. the constructor is called
when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class? Ans: A class can have multiple constructors.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation? Ans: It is called the default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java? Ans: "This" refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use? Ans: Super is a reference variable which is used to refer
immediate parent class object. You can use it 3 ways. Parent class instance variable, parent class method, and parent class
constructor.

What is JVM stand for? Ans: Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent? Ans: JVM is not platform independent, it is dependent.

What version of java are you using? Ans: 8.0

What is JAR stand for? Ans: Java ARchive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM? Ans: JDK is a software development kit and JVM is an environment for
executing bytecode.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE? Ans: JVM is an environment for executing bytecode and JRE is a software
bundle that allows Java program to run.

What is compile time and run time? Ans: Compile time is when the program is compiled; runtime is when it executes

What is heap? Ans: The area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM.

How java manage it's memory? Ans: Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder? Ans: Strings are treated as objects. String class
to create and manipulate strings. StringBuffer class is a thread-safe, mutable sequence of characters. StringBuilder is
a class used to create a mutable.

What is Singleton class? Ans: Singleton class is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization? Ans: Serialization is to convert its state to a byte stream so that the byte
stream can be reverted back into a copy of the object. And Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream
is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java? Ans: Is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization
process.

Difference between while and do..while loop? Ans: While loop checks the condition first and then executes the statement.
do while loop will execute the statement(s) at least once, then the condition is checked.

What is Enum? Ans: An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants

What is Iterator? Ans: Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer? Ans: Integer because it is an object class which takes 16 bytes to
store. And is primitive data type and takes 4 byte to store.

Why is String Immutable in Java? Ans: Because string objects are cached in the String pool.

What is constructor chaining in Java? Ans: Constructor chaining is the process of invoking a sequence of constructors
upon initialization of a class object

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector? Ans: Serial garbage collector uses a single thread for
garbage collection process while the parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads for the garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for? Ans: Just-In-Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection? Ans: The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease
in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. The garbage collection objects that
are no longer used are cleared.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process? Ans: No it does not guarantee.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java? Ans: Heap Space is used throughout the application, but Stack
is only used for the method

What is reflection in java and why is it useful? Ans:Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows
an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program.
what is multi thread in java? Ans: a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously.

What is the use of synchronization in Java? Ans:is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.

What is Framework? Ans: The body or platform of already written codes.

What are the testing Framework available in java? Ans: TestNG, JUint, JBehave.

Difference between jUnit and testNG? Ans: TestNG is a Java-based framework that is an upgraded option for running tests.
JUnit does not support to run parallel tests.

What are the dependencies for this project? Ans:

what is dependency injection in java? Ans: The concept in which objects get other required objects from outside.

What is static binding and dynamic binding? Ans: Static binding happens when all information needed to call a function
is available at the compile-time. Dynamic binding happens when the compiler cannot determine all information needed for

a function call at compile-time.
